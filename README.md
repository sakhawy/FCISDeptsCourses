**NOTE:** To keep it real, I planned to take the syllabus from previous versions of FCIS-MU courses (official lecture notes, professors' GitHub repos, and lecture slides). I was trying to get as close to the official FCIS-MU material.

**NOTE:** Courses tagged with **\[EXTERNAL\]** means the syllabus is taken from the internet. It should be close enough to the official FCIS-MU material. 

**NOTE:** The syllabus is subject to change.

**NOTE:** You're more than welcome to contribute to the repo -- especially if you spot any mistakes!
